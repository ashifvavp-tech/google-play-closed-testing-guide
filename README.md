# Google Play Closed Testing – 12 Testers for 14 Days

Google Play now requires new developers to complete closed testing with real engagement.

## Common Problems
- Testers install once and disappear
- No daily activity tracking
- No reminders
- Rejections despite 12 testers

## Better Testing Approach
Closed testing works best when:
- Testers return daily
- Participation is tracked
- Developers help each other

 Apps like Closed Test Pro focus on daily testing, reminders, and real-time stats instead of one-time installs.

## Resources
- Google Play Console
- Closed Test Pro (Available on play store)
